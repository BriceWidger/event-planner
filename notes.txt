I've decided to not use Typescript, not because it's complicating the code, but because it's unecessary when putting it in the top-level component, as the benefits of React.js and bootstrap are clean and minimal code.

I'm getting the hang of the react.js component structure. I am also feeling more familiar with bootstrap syntax. JSX is also becoming more familiar. So far, so good. No suggestions for next session.
