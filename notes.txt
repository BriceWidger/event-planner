I have came up with a gameplan. The game plan is to create breakpoints for the following sizes:

Mobile (320px and below): This is the smallest screen size and is typically used for mobile devices.
Tablet (768px and below): This is a slightly larger screen size and is typically used for tablets.
Desktop (992px and below): This is a larger screen size and is typically used for desktop computers.
Large Desktop (1200px and above): This is the largest screen size and is typically used for large desktop computers.

I have created these default sizes in the firefox devtool mobile mode, and now i should start at 320px and work my way down the page with respinsive design in mind.

When I'm done with building the entire page in responsive design at 320px, then i can test this responsiveness at 768px, etc.
